These are some examples of using Python to run code on a Databricks cluster, using different approaches:
- The DB SQL connector (python client for Databricks SQL)
- The Execution Context API for running PySpark Commands on an interactive (All-purpose) cluster
- Using the Databricks-CLI package for convenience and calling the RunsSumbit API to run a notebook
