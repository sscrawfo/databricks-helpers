Saving the best model in the Model Registry\n\nThe MLflow Model Registry component is a centralized model store, set of APIs, and UI, to collaboratively manage the full lifecycle of an MLflow Model. It provides model lineage (which MLflow Experiment and Run produced the model), model versioning, stage transitions (e.g. from staging to production), annotations (e.g. with comments, tags), and deployment management (e.g. which production jobs have requested a specific model version).\n\nModel registry has the following features:\n\n* **Central Repository:** Register MLflow models with the MLflow Model Registry. A registered model has a unique name, version, stage, and other metadata.\n* **Model Versioning:** Automatically keep track of versions for registered models when updated.\n* **Model Stage:** Assigned preset or custom stages to each model version, like “Staging” and “Production” to represent the lifecycle of a model.\n* **Model Stage Transitions:** Record new registration events or changes as activities that automatically log users, changes, and additional metadata such as comments.\n* **CI/CD Workflow Integration:** Record stage transitions, request, review and approve changes as part of CI/CD pipelines for better control and governance.\n\n<div><img src=\"https://files.training.databricks.com/images/eLearning/ML-Part-4/model-registry.png\" style=\"height: 400px; margin: 20px\"/></div>\n\n<img alt=\"Side Note\" title=\"Side Note\" style=\"vertical-align: text-bottom; position: relative; height:1.75em; top:0.05em; transform:rotate(15deg)\" src=\"https://files.training.databricks.com/static/images/icon-note.webp\"/> See <a href=\"https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/registry.html\" target=\"_blank\">the MLflow docs</a> for more details on the model registry.","commandVersion":26,"state":"finished","results":null,"resultDbfsStatus":"INLINED_IN_TREE","resultDbfsErrorMessage":null,"errorSummary":null,"errorTraceType":null,"error":null,"workflows":[],"startTime":0,"submitTime":0,"finishTime":0,"collapsed":false,"bindings":{},"inputWidgets":{},"displayType":"table","width":"auto","height":"auto","xColumns":null,"yColumns":null,"pivotColumns":null,"pivotAggregation":null,"useConsistentColors":false,"customPlotOptions":{},"commentThread":[],"commentsVisible":false,"parentHierarchy":[],"diffInserts":[],"diffDeletes":[],"globalVars":{},"latestUser":"a user","latestUserId":null,"commandTitle":"","showCommandTitle":false,"hideCommandCode":false,"hideCommandResult":false,"isLockedInExamMode":false,"iPythonMetadata":null,"metadata":{"rowLimit":10000,"byteLimit":2048000},"streamStates":{},"datasetPreviewNameToCmdIdMap":{},"tableResultIndex":null,"listResultMetadata":null,"subcommandOptions":null,"contentSha256Hex":null,"nuid":"c492b3f9-5596-45ae-9cab-e6773d0e1669"},{"version":"CommandV1","origId":1053375282066918,"guid":"72dd32c5-4c96-4936-b589-f1c2de6908f0","subtype":"command","commandType":"auto","position":12.75,"command":"%md \nLet's deploy our best model in production.
