In almost all cases, the raw data requires preprocessing and transformation before it can be used to build a model. This process is called featurization or feature engineering, and the outputs of this process are called features - the building blocks of the model.\n\nDeveloping features is complex and time-consuming. An additional complication is that for machine learning, the featurization calculations need to be done for model training, and then again when the model is used to make predictions. These implementations may not be done by the same team or using the same code environment, which can lead to delays and errors. Also, different teams in an organization will often have similar feature needs but may not be aware of work that other teams have done. A feature store is designed to address these problems.\n\n## ![Spark Logo Tiny](https://files.training.databricks.com/images/105/logo_spark_tiny.png) In this notebook, we will:<br>\n- Compute and write features\n- Train a model using these features to predict fares\n- Evaluate that model on a new batch of data using existing features, saved to Feature Store\n \n## Requirements\n- Databricks Runtime for Machine Learning 10.2 or above.

It's been very convenient to define features and compute them with Spark and persist them for batch use. However, these features need to be available \"online\" too. It would be prohibitively slow recompute features in real-time. The features are already computed, but exist in tables which may be slow to read individual rows from; the Delta tables may not be accessible, even, from the real-time serving context!\n\nThe Feature Store can \"publish\" the data in these tables to an external store that is more suitable for fast online lookups. The `publish_table` method accomplishes this. Additional documentation on working with online feature stores is [available here](https://docs.databricks.com/applications/machine-learning/feature-store/online-feature-stores.html).","commandVersion":30,"state":"finished","results":null,"resultDbfsStatus":"INLINED_IN_TREE","resultDbfsErrorMessage":null,"errorSummary":null,"errorTraceType":null,"error":null,"workflows":[],"startTime":0,"submitTime":0,"finishTime":0,"collapsed":false,"bindings":{},"inputWidgets":{},"displayType":"table","width":"auto","height":"auto","xColumns":null,"yColumns":null,"pivotColumns":null,"pivotAggregation":null,"useConsistentColors":false,"customPlotOptions":{},"commentThread":[],"commentsVisible":false,"parentHierarchy":[],"diffInserts":[],"diffDeletes":[],"globalVars":{},"latestUser":"a user","latestUserId":null,"commandTitle":"","showCommandTitle":false,"hideCommandCode":false,"hideCommandResult":false,"isLockedInExamMode":false,"iPythonMetadata":null,"metadata":{"rowLimit":10000,"byteLimit":2048000},"streamStates":{},"datasetPreviewNameToCmdIdMap":{},"tableResultIndex":null,"listResultMetadata":null,"subcommandOptions":null,"contentSha256Hex":null,"nuid":"8fe6698b-7151-45d9-9804-3daeaec02326"},{"version":"CommandV1","origId":1053375282067013,"guid":"d0fe20bb-0767-4be0-b40a-c83475a2a072","subtype":"command","commandType":"auto","position":13.0,"command":"%md-sandbox\n&copy; 2022 Databricks, Inc.
